            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey into AI product management began with a fascination for how technology 
                can augment human capabilities. With a background in both computer science and business 
                strategy, I found my calling at the intersection of artificial intelligence and product 
                development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with innovative companies and talented 
                teams to build AI products that have impacted millions of users. From conversational AI 
                to predictive analytics, computer vision to natural language processing, I've explored 
                diverse AI domains and learned that the key to successful AI products lies not just in 
                the technology, but in deeply understanding user needs and business objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I focus on helping organizations navigate the complex landscape of AI product 
                development, ensuring that AI solutions are not only technically sound but also ethically 
                responsible, user-friendly, and commercially viable.

                    <h3>User-Centric AI</h3>
                    <p>
                        AI should enhance, not complicate. Every feature must solve a real user problem 
                        and provide clear value. Technology serves users, not the other way around.

                    <p>
                        With great AI power comes great responsibility. I'm committed to building fair, 
                        transparent, and privacy-respecting AI products that benefit society.

                        The AI field evolves rapidly. Staying curious, learning constantly, and 
                        adapting quickly are essential to building products that remain relevant.

                        While intuition matters, data provides clarity. I believe in making decisions 
                        backed by evidence, metrics, and user feedback.
