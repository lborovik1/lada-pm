  "Standard Deviation": "A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values",
  "Variance": "The average of the squared differences from the mean",
  "Correlation": "A statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables are related",
  "Regression": "A statistical method for estimating relationships among variables",
  "Hypothesis": "A proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for investigation",
