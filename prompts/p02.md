=======================================================
I have renamed the images and put them under directory
   website/images

please update the code to use images from this directory

=======================================================
The game shows the term and its explanation.
The terms are always in English.
I want to add a button next to each term 
(to the left of the button) to provide audio 
(text to speech) to read the text in this button.
This audio should work on all platforms (MacOS, Windows, ...)

What are possible simple solutions?
